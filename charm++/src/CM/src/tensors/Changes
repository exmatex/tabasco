Change log for tensor classes

From 0.2 to 0.3:

- added Tensor2Sym square(Tensor2Sym) function

- added void findroots(const Tensor2Sym&, Tensor2Sym*, Tensor2Sym*) function

- polarRight() and polarLeft() do not supply eigen values and vectors
  any longer, use eigen() instead. The RU and VR calculation are now
  performed with the Franca algorithm, not iteratively.

- added specialization for Tensor2Sym::invariants(...) for efficiency
